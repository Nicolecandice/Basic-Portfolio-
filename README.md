The Basic Portfolio is my portfolio which is built to display the my ability  as a professional front and back ground web developer.
The index. links to the portfolio.  and the contact.
Index.html provides information about my background, while the portfolio provides links to my work where user can access
and the contact html has links where the user can connect Me..........
This portfolio was built with HTML and CSS only. Its also the first class assignment, which I will be enhancing, whiles the program progresses during the course.
