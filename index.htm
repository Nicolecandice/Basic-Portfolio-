						<p> I’m an aspiring Front and Back End Developer who was born in the little island of Trinidad & Tobago known for its asphalt
							and oil refinery. I have obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Information Management Technology. Since 2008 I have been
							pursuing the field of technology in which has become my main career path and a hobby I enjoy a great deal. I also
							enjoy singing in my church choir, reading and meet-up groups. <p>My main goal is to become a Professional Web Developer
							and Teacher of Technology for adults and students who are challenged learners and who are looking for the opportunity
							to learn the functionality of this world. Some steps I have taken to fulfill my targeted goal have been to join the
							Rutgers coding boot camp. The boot camp has already given me the skills to build a professional website using HTML
							(Hyper-Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) The material is A++ and the code is C-shape. Before that
							I was focusing on building my database skills and perfecting SQL (Structured Query Language). </p>There is a saying, “If
							you give a man a fish he will be happy for that fish, but, if you teach a man to fish and he will be skilled for life
							and a great contributor to his society”.
